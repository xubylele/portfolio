      Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Xavier DÃ­az but everyone calls me Xavi or Xuby. I started in the
      world of computing like many of us, through video games on my first PC. Currently I'm a <span

        >Software Engineer
      </span> at imed, an important technology company in the healthcare sector.

      Some of my professional achievements include the development of <span
        class='text-lg md:text-xl space-y-4 text-[#f6ea5d]/90'
        >Reports Server
      </span>, a REST API server that allows generating dynamic reports in
      PDF format. It's very important in my career because I had to
      explore many new technologies for me like <span
        class='text-lg md:text-xl space-y-4 text-[#f6ea5d]/90'
        >Python, Flask and Jinja2</span
      >.

      I also have a side project creating VSCode extensions.
      During the development of Report Server, I realized I needed an
      extension that would allow me to visualize Jinja2 code in a more
      user-friendly way. And on the other hand, I needed a way to convert files
      to and from base64 quickly and locally. This is how <a

      were born. They currently have more than <span
        class='text-lg md:text-xl space-y-4 text-[#f6ea5d]/90'
      >
        1000 downloads</span
      > between both extensions and I plan to continue adding more features in
      the future.

      In my free time I like to play video games, I'm a musician and learning
      music production. I'm a technology enthusiast and I like to stay
      up to date with the latest trends in the world of computing and do
      personal projects for the love of art.
